Kernels Redistribution
----------------------
Redistribution of SPICE kernels distributed by NAIF is permitted as long as they have not been modified.
If a kernel distributed by NAIF has been modified in any way, any embedded or otherwise allied attribution of the
original kernel producer must be replaced with the name and institution of whomever has made the last modification.
Redistribution of kernels distributed by any other entity is subject to the rules on and of that entity.
