/// Problem: different conventions define the same fundamental arguments differently for the same
/// bodies. For example, the mean longitude of the ascending node of the Moon is defined differently
/// in the IERS2003 and MHB2000 conventions. The set of traits defined in fundamental.rs is
/// IERS2003-only, but we don't want to define a new trait for each combination of conventions and
/// argument, which will quickly get out of hand and lead to long, convoluted method names to
/// avoid clashes when implemented on the same body. Nor do we want to define a new body for
/// each set of conventions â€“ there are enough of them as it is.
///
/// Proposed solution: Following a recommendation in Rust for Rustaceans, we can define a marker type for
/// each convention, make the body generic over the marker, and implement the same trait for each
/// marker. The body remains zero-sized, its instances are constant, and there's no need to
/// namespace fundamental arguments trait declarations.
///
/// This is also clearer for consumers of the API, who no longer have to wonder why mod fundamental
/// provides only IERS03 fundamental args.

/// Marker types indicating the conventions followed by the body.
